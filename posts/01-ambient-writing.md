**MAKE ME FEEL ...** How does one feel? Through the senses. Sight,
sound, smell, touch and taste. Sunsets, laughter, perfume, hugs and chocolate.
If your writing does not make me feel, it is as good as a corpse. Rotting.
Emitting dead odors. As the grass beneath beseech it and the maggots infest the top.
It should shrill and shriek. Read like beautiful music. A birdsong; sung
high in the morning trees, passed down through generation.

Machines may imitate. Their imitations are our imitations; all of our
data collected. Processed and pre-processed to an artificial ideal. A flower
without a bee. A heart that does not beat. They cannot feel. 

* Avoid using complex language. If your friends would not understand it, then how would the world?
* You should be able to tell your story aloud. A good practice is to start
from this notion and work backwards. Tell your story, then embellish
it in your writing.
* If your writing, be it a paragraph, sentence or word, does
not contribute to the telling of the story, remove it.
If your writing does not make me feel. Bin it. Burn it. Break it.


Let the machines hum in the background to the symphony of our heart's beat.
