**MAKE ME FEEL ...** How does one feel? Through the senses. Sight,
sound, smell, touch and taste. Sunsets, laughter, perfume, hugs and chocolate.
If your writing does not make me feel, it is as good as a corpse. Rotting.
Emitting dead odors. As the grass beneath beseech it and the maggots infest the top.
It should shrill and shriek. Read like beautiful music. A birdsong; sung
high in the morning trees, passed down through generation.

Machines may imitate. Their imitations are our imitations; all of our
data collected. Processed and pre-processed to an artificial ideal. A flower
without a bee. A heart that does not beat. They cannot feel. 

Let the machines hum in the background to the symphony of our heart's beat.
