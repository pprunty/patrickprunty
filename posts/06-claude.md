It is sometimes easier to show rather than tell, so here is [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), Anthropic A.I's latest Large
Language Model (LLM), similar to ChatGPT but offering differences in user experience and performance.

You might assume Anthropic and their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model have French origins given the name. However, that is not
the case. _Claude_ is actually named after [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), widely
regarded as the father of information theory. In fact, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by seven former OpenAI members,
with
siblings
Daniela and Dario Amodei at the helm &mdash; both Italian-Americans. _Huh_, perhaps names like _Leonardo_ or
_Michelangelo_
were taken?

Anthropic have since attracted significant financial backing from major players in the tech industry. In 2022, they
announced $580 million in funding, with $500 million coming from FTX under Sam Bankman-Fried's
leadership. _Remember him_? More recently, Amazon completed a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, in a deal whereby
Anthropic agreed to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and make its AI models available to AWS
customers. Google has also committed $2 billion in investment. This $6.58 billion in funding is impressive for a young
company. In comparison, OpenAI has received about $11 billion, mostly from Microsoft. While OpenAI leads in total
funding, Anthropic's diverse investments signal strong confidence in its potential to disrupt the AI landscape.

So what sets Claude apart from other Large Language Models?

Claude's distinct branding immediately sets it apart from ChatGPT. Its interface features a sophisticated palette of
neutral tones and whimsical stenciled figures, creating a refined yet playful aesthetic. Claude's serif font adds
classical elegance, contrasting with ChatGPT's modern sans-serif style. This thoughtful design conveys professionalism
while maintaining approachability, aligning with Anthropic's AI philosophy. Claude feels playful yet
professional, whilst ChatGPT feels practical and original.

By default, the Claude prompt is positioned centrally, with previous conversations hidden. This design choice enhances
privacy and focus &mdash; no more worrying about whether your colleagues seen your last conversation titled,
'Ideas for new sex positions' when you last shared your screen &mdash; _hooray!_ This small but significant improvement 
in user experience highlights Anthropic's attention to practical details and user experience.

Additionally, you'll notice that Claude provides expanded reasoning for its responses. For instance, if you ask Claude
to make an email sound more professional, it will not only rewrite the email but also list the reasons why the changes
make it more professional.

One of Claude's standout features is its availability as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This functionality allows users to
install Claude on their desktop, providing a native app-like experience without the need for traditional app store
downloads. To take advantage of this feature in Google Chrome, simply click the download button in the browser's address
bar:

This PWA capability sets Claude apart from OpenAI's ChatGPT, which currently lacks this convenient installation option.
The ability to use Claude as a desktop app enhances accessibility and integrates seamlessly into users' workflows. For
those interested in the technical aspects of PWAs, I have written a detailed guide
on [How to Make Your NextJS/ReactJS Application a Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://patrickprunty.com/blog/04-nextjs-pwa).
