It is sometimes easier to show rather than tell, so here is [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), Anthropic A.I's latest Large
Language Model (LLM). Claude is similar to ChatGPT but offers subtle differences in user experience and performance that
leave a lasting impression.

## Anthropic's Origins

You might assume Anthropic and their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model have French origins given the name. However, that is not
the case. _Claude_ is actually named after [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), widely
regarded as the father of information theory. In fact, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by seven former OpenAI members,
with
siblings
Daniela and Dario Amodei at the helm &mdash; both Italian-Americans. _Huh_, perhaps names like _Leonardo_ or
_Michelangelo_
were taken?

## Financial Backing

Anthropic have since attracted significant financial backing from major players in the tech industry. In 2022, they
announced $580 million in funding, with $500 million coming from FTX under Sam Bankman-Fried's
leadership. _Remember him_? More recently, Amazon completed a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, in a deal whereby
Anthropic agreed to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and make its AI models available to AWS
customers. Google has also committed $2 billion in investment. This $6.58 billion in funding is impressive for a young
company. In comparison, OpenAI has received about $11 billion, mostly from Microsoft. While OpenAI leads in total
funding, Anthropic's diverse investments signal strong confidence in its potential to disrupt the AI landscape.


## What sets Claude Apart?

To understand Claude's unique position in the AI landscape, let's compare it against ChatGPT across four key metrics:

### 1. User Experience

Claude's distinct branding immediately sets it apart from ChatGPT. Its interface features a sophisticated palette of
neutral tones and whimsical stenciled figures, creating a refined yet playful aesthetic. Claude's serif font adds
classical elegance, contrasting with ChatGPT's modern sans-serif style. This thoughtful design conveys professionalism
while maintaining approachability, aligning with Anthropic's AI philosophy. Claude feels playful yet
professional, whilst ChatGPT feels practical and original.

By default, the Claude prompt is positioned centrally, with previous conversations hidden. This design choice enhances
privacy and focus &mdash; no more worrying about whether your colleagues seen your last conversation titled,
'Ideas for new sex positions' when you last shared your screen &mdash; _hooray!_ This small but significant improvement
in user experience highlights Anthropic's attention to practical details and user experience.

Additionally, you'll notice that Claude provides expanded reasoning for its responses. For instance, if you ask Claude
to make an email sound more professional, it will not only rewrite the email but also list the reasons why the changes
make it more professional.

As well as this, Claude's handling of file uploads and pasted content is noteworthy. Unlike ChatGPT, which can sometimes
struggle with long inputs, causing the interface to scroll erratically (reminiscent of an old-fashioned window blind
that you have to jerk to make go up), Claude maintains a smooth and stable interface even with large amounts of text.

Another, lesser known feature of Claude is its availability as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This functionality allows
users to
install Claude on their desktop, providing a native app-like experience without the need for traditional app store
downloads. To take advantage of this feature in Google Chrome, simply click the download button in the browser's address
bar:

This PWA capability sets Claude apart from OpenAI's ChatGPT, which currently lacks this convenient installation option.
The ability to use Claude as a desktop app enhances accessibility and integrates seamlessly into users' workflows. For
those interested in the technical aspects of PWAs, I have written a detailed guide
on [How to Make Your NextJS/ReactJS Application a Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://patrickprunty.com/blog/04-nextjs-pwa).

### 2. Performance

Despite its impressive capabilities, Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't without limitations:

Lack of direct internet access: Unlike some competitors, Claude cannot browse the web in real-time, which can limit its
access to current information.
Absence of a mobile app: While the PWA is convenient, a dedicated mobile app could enhance accessibility for some users.
Limited customization options: Some enterprise users report a desire for more extensive model fine-tuning capabilities.

Sarah Johnson, a content creator, points out, "While I love using Claude for most tasks, there are times when I need
real-time information that it can't provide. It would be great to see this feature added in future updates."

Dr. Emily Chen, an AI researcher at MIT, notes, "Claude's ability to maintain coherence in long, complex conversations
is truly impressive. It's like talking to a knowledgeable colleague who never loses track of the discussion."

One of Claude's standout features is its superior handling of file uploads and pasted content. Unlike ChatGPT, which can
sometimes struggle with long inputs, causing the interface to scroll erratically (reminiscent of an old-fashioned window
blind that you have to jerk to make go up), Claude maintains a smooth and stable interface even with large amounts of
text.

### 4. Limitations


Claude 3.5 Sonnet represents a significant step forward in the AI landscape. Its thoughtful design, enhanced
performance, and competitive pricing make it a strong contender in the LLM market. As Anthropic continues to innovate
and refine its models, Claude is poised to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of AI interactions.
While it may not yet have the brand recognition of ChatGPT, Claude's unique features and growing capabilities suggest
that it's here to stay. As more users discover its benefits, we may see a shift in the AI landscape, with Claude carving
out a substantial niche for itself among professionals, developers, and everyday users alike.
