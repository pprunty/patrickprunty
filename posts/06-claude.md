It is sometimes easier to show rather than tell, so here is [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), Anthropic A.I's Large
Language Model (LLM) similar to ChatGPT but offering a different experience.

You might have guessed Anthopic and their Claude Sonnet 3.5 model was founded by a French company. If you did, you are
unfortunately wrong.
Their AI model is called _Claude_ in honour of [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), who is
widely regarded as the father of information theory.
In actuality, Anthropic was founded by seven former members of OpenAI, including Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei at the
forefront &mdash; two Italian-American brothers.
Huh, maybe the names _Leonardo_ or _Michaelangelo_ were taken?

In 2022, Anthropic announced it had received $580 million in funding, with $500 million of this funding coming from FTX
under the leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried.
Hey, _remember that guy?_ Amazon recently completed their $4 billion investment in Antropic in a deal whereby Anthropic
would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and make its AI models available to AWS customers.
Google, likewise have committed to a total of $2 billion in investment.

I use LLMs for two purposes: coding and personal writing. So what makes Claude different to any of the other Large
Language Model _clones_?

At a high-level, claude has all the same bells and whistles ChatGPT has.
