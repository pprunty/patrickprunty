(DRAFT)

House of the Dragon is back! The first episode of House of the Dragon season 2 covers the happenings of the two divisions 
of the Targaryen household, the Blacks &mdash; Rhanerya, Daemon and co., and the Greens &mdash; Alicent, Otto, King Aegon II and co.

This episode takes place directly after the happenings of the final episode of the previous season where we are introduced 
to the Stark household, when Luke Targaryen treats with __ Stark at the Wall, Lord of Winterfell; the Stark family's household.

Luke reminds __ Stark of the oath his father swore to Visery's Targaryen to acknowledge Rhaneyra as rightful heir to the 
Iron Throne, to which__ Stark replies:

> The Starks do not forget their oaths easily."

__ Stark emphasises his priority to guard realm against what is north of the wall, offering Luke Targaryen only 
2,000 "greybeards" to support Rhaneyra's claim against the Greens.

They are interrupted, as a letter arrives to The Wall, bearing news that Luke's brother, Jhaerys was murdered by Aaemond 
Targayen and his dragon Vhagar.

__ Stark is only 17 at this time and is known as somewhat of a badass, so it will interesting to see if his character reappears
as the season progresses.

The remaining happenings of the episode take place mainly in King's Landing, where The Greens reside and hold the throne, and
Dragonstone, where the Blacks plot their war against the greens.

> [I'm afraid] of the rats."

We will watch to see how his character develops after hearing the news of his brother.



Aegon embodies many of his father Viserysâ€™ traits, particularly his reluctance to rule, despite the fierce competition 
for around him for the throne. This character trait; not desiring to rule, yet having the duty to do so, traditionally 
makes for a compelling and strong ruler.  But we will have to wait and see how this unfolds.

Aeemond, drunkingly says:

> My brother is like a dog. He will ...

This hints that he may consider replacing Otto Hightower as his Hand with his brother Aaemond, whom will offer a more 
pragmatic than dogmatic council in their war efforts.


In fact, Rhaneyra speaks only one line in the entire episode, when she appears in front of her council after recovering 
the body of her late son Jhaerys, which is:

> I want Aaemond Targaryen."


We see ___ , recovered somewhat from his critical condition reel over the news that his heir apparent to Driftmark was murdered by
Aeemond Targaryen and his dragon, Vhagar.


> A son for a son."

This echoes Alicent's demands in epsiode __ of the first season when she demands Jhaerys be punished for taking Aaemond's 
eye, by demanding __, ... of the Kingsgaurd and her paramour, take Jhaerys' eye; adjudicating _an eye for an eye_. Of course,
King Visery intervenes, and Jhaerys goes unpunished and keeps his eye.


We are treated to wrenching sounds as King Aaegon II's heir to the Iron Throne and child, Jhaerys's head is cut from his 
body by the rat snatchers.
