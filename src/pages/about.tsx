My name is Patrick Prunty and Iâ€™m a Fullstack Software Engineer at Optum Healthcare. Previously, I studied MSc. in High-Performance Computing at Trinity College Dublin and B.A Joint Honours in Mathematics and English Literature at University College Dublin (with minor in Portuguese). I am currently working on a couple of open source projects and the release of a mobile application to the iOS and Android app stores.

I do triathlon (swim, cycle and run), travel and follow Chelsea Football Club. I also write on a variety of topics ranging from science and technology to creative prose.        My name is Patrick Prunty... in my spare time I train triathlon, Brasillian Jiu Jitsu, hike and spent time with my loved ones.
